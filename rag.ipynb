      "CT scan of the head is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?\"\n",
      "Option A. Subgaleal hemorrhage:\n",
      "  - It is critical to obtain a detailed and focused history. History Comments Timing of the symptoms onset The time the patient was last normal Initial symptoms The progression of symptoms Vascular risk factors Hypertension Smoking Medications Decongestants Antihypertensive medications Stimulants (including diet pills) Sympathomimetics Recent trauma History of recent fall or accident Dementia Associated with amyloid angiopathy Alcohol or illicit drug use Cocaine Other sympathomimetic drugs Cancer History of brain or cervical tumors It is impossible to know whether symptoms are due to ischemia, hemorrhage, or other medical reason based on clinical characteristics alone. The abrupt onset of focal neurologic symptoms is presumed to be vascular in origin. Non specific symptoms of hemorrhagic stroke may include the following: Severe headache (as a worst headache of the life) Double vision Nausea and vomiting Symptoms meningeal irritation Nuchal rigidity and pain Back pain Bilateral leg pain Numbness Weakness Sudden decreased level of consciousness Rapid progression of symptoms Speech disturbance (Distance: 0.823186457157135)\n",
      "  - Differential diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage may include ischemic stroke, SAH, TIA, acute hypertensive crisis, sentinel headache, sinusitis, hypoglycemia, cerebral venous thrombosis, spontaneous intracranial hypotension, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. It is clinically difficult to distinguish ICH or subarchnoid hemorrhage (SAH) from an ischemic stroke. However, the symptoms like headache, nausea, vomiting, and depressed level of consciousness should raise the suspicion for a hemorrhagic event compared to ischemic stroke. (Distance: 0.8409380912780762)\n",
      "  - Lower haemoglobin levels may impair cerebral oxygen delivery and threaten tissue viability in the setting of acute brain injury. Few studies have examined the association between haemoglobin levels and outcomes after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. We evaluated whether anaemia on admission was associated with greater intracerebral haemorrhage severity and worse outcome. Consecutive patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage were analyzed from the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network. Admission haemoglobin was related to stroke severity (using the Canadian Neurological Scale), modified Rankin score at discharge, and one-year mortality. Adjustment was made for potential confounders including age, gender, medical history, warfarin use, glucose, creatinine, blood pressure, and intraventricular haemorrhage. Two thousand four hundred six patients with intracerebral haemorrhage were studied of whom 23% had anaemia (haemoglobin <120 g/l) on admission, including 4% with haemoglobin <100 g/l. Patients with anaemia were more likely to have severe neurological deficits at presentation [haemoglobin ≤ 100 g/l, adjusted odds ratio 4.04 (95% confidence interval 2.39, 6.84); haemoglobin 101-120 g/l, adjusted odds ratio 1.93 (95% confidence interval 1.43, 2.59), both P < 0.0001]. In nonanticoagulated patients, severe anaemia was also associated with poor outcome (modified Rankin score 4-6) at discharge [haemoglobin ≤ 100 g/l, adjusted odds ratio 2.42 (95% confidence interval 1.07-5.47), P = 0.034] and increased mortality at one-year [haemoglobin ≤ 100 g/l, adjusted hazard ratio 1.73 (95% confidence interval 1.22-2.45), P = 0.002]. (Distance: 0.8775157928466797)\n",
      "  - In a patient with thunderclap headache, none of the signs mentioned are helpful in confirming or ruling out hemorrhage, although a seizure makes bleeding from an aneurysm more likely. Physical examination should include vital sign, level of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)) eye examination, and neurologic examination. (Distance: 0.8843036890029907)\n",
      "  - The objective was to see if hyperglycemia in the emergency department predicted traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) for infants and young children. A 6-year retrospective chart review was performed on patients younger than 3 years. Patients identified from the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) database with ICH on computer tomography were compared with those with a history of trauma without ICH identified from a radiology database. Subgroup analysis was performed on the ICH group comparing abusive head trauma (AHT) and accidental. Primary outcomes measured were initial serum glucose level, length of stay, length of ventilation, mortality, and disability on discharge. Fifty-three patients were admitted to the PICU with traumatic ICH with an overall mortality of 7.5%. The average initial glucose in the emergency department was significantly higher for the patients with ICH than those without (164 vs. 99 mg/dL, P < 0.0001). Combining elevated serum glucose with any abnormality in Glasgow Coma Scale score yielded sensitivity and specificity of 100%. The average presenting glucose was higher for AHT compared with accidental injury (190 vs. 133 mg/dL, P < 0.001). Patients with AHT had greater PICU and hospital length of stay and more severe disabilities on discharge (P < 0.001). (Distance: 0.8857152462005615)\n",
      "Option B. Cerebral sinus venous thrombosis:\n",
      "  - In recent studies, coma, cerebral hemorrhage, older age, and infectious origin have been identified as prognostic factors in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). However, no studies of the prognosis of CVT have evaluated hemodynamic factors. However, it is conceivable that the presence or absence and the efficiency of venous collaterals, as well as recanalization, may have an impact on brain tissue damage and hence on the prognosis of acute CVT. Twenty-six patients with acute CVT (mean age, 40+/-15 years) were recruited prospectively. All patients were treated with intravenous heparin, followed by oral anticoagulation for 12 months, except for 2 patients who were lost to follow-up after hospital discharge. Neurological deficits were graded on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale on admission, at hospital discharge, and at 90+/-14 days after admission. The functional clinical outcome was graded on the modified Rankin Scale on day 90 after admission. All patients received a venous transcranial duplex sonography (TCCS) on admission and were followed up in case of a pathological result until normalization was recorded (mean follow-up, 316+/-395 days; range, 13 to 1180 days). Initial TCCS was pathological in 18 of 26 patients (69%).

The present study was undertaken to analyze the headache-associated factors, the possible related biochemical mechanisms, and the headache potential predictors of outcome in spontaneous ICH. We prospectively studied 189 patients from a large cohort of 266 consecutive patients with supratentorial ICH admitted within the first 12 hours of symptoms onset. The presence of headache at stroke onset was evaluated in these patients. The volumes of the initial ICH, peripheral edema at 48 hours, and the residual cavity at 3 months were measured on CT scan. Glutamate, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha levels were measured in blood samples obtained on admission. The Canadian Stroke Scale (CSS) and the modified Rankin Scale were used to evaluate stroke severity and neurological outcome, respectively. Headache at onset of stroke was observed in 65 patients (34.4%). Patients who experienced headache had a significantly higher frequency of history of infection (P= .009) or inflammation (P= .045), as well as higher body temperature (P= .021), leukocyte count (P= .038), ESR (P= .011), and mass effect (P= .017) on admission. Plasma concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were significantly higher in patients with headache than in those without.

Twenty-three patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury and an evacuated extradural hematoma or diffuse injury served as the control group. Outcome was evaluated by means of the Glasgow Outcome Scale at 12 months. Values for the maximum (rCBFmax) and the mean of all rCBF levels in the cortex beneath the evacuated SDH were more frequently consistent with hyperemia. The side-to-side differences in the mean of all rCBF and rCBFmax levels between lesioned and nonlesioned hemispheres were greater in patients with evacuated SDH than in controls (P = 0.0013 and P = 0.0018, respectively). The side-to-side difference in the maximum rCBF value was higher in SDH patients with unfavorable outcomes than in controls at 24 to 96 hours and at 4 to 7 days and higher than in patients with favorable outcomes at 4 to 7 days.

People with mild hemophilia (5-40% of factor VIII / IX activity in the blood) generally present with excessive bleeding following surgery (such as a dental procedure) or trauma. They may remain asymptomatic otherwise for long period of time, even into late adulthood. People with moderate hemophilia (1-5% of factor VIII/ IX activity in the blood) have presentation ranging between mild and severe forms. They present earlier than patients with mild hemophilia, and may bleed following minor trauma. People with severe hemophilia (less than 1% of factor VIII/ IX in blood) present sooner in life with abnormal bleeding episodes, usually in the first year of life. They are also at risk for spontaneous hemorrhages, i.e. unprovoked bleeding episodes, frequently in the joints and muscles . It is proposed that there are many other determinants beyond factor levels that influence the severity of the disease; these include type of genetic defects, fibrinolytic potential, alterations of other genes involved in hemostasis and inflammatory processes, and age of the patient at the first joint bleeding episode . For many years it was believed that Hemophilia B is practically indistinguishable from Hemophilia A; However, several Recent studies proposed that Hemophilia B is much less severe disease than Hemophilia A when equal factor measures present . These studies indicate on lower frequency of bleeding episodes and need for regular prophylaxis and joint arthroplasty surgeries in Hemophilia B patients compared to Hemophilia A.

      "Option B. Von Willebrand factor:\n",
      "  - Problems with coagulation may dispose to hemorrhage, thrombosis, and occasionally both, depending on the nature of the pathology. Platelet conditions may be inborn or acquired. Some inborn platelet pathologies are Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, Bernard-Soulier syndrome (abnormal glycoprotein Ib-IX-V complex), gray platelet syndrome (deficient alpha granules) and delta storage pool deficiency (deficient dense granules). Most are rare conditions. Most inborn platelet pathologies predispose to hemorrhage. von Willebrand disease is due to deficiency or abnormal function of von Willebrand factor, and leads to a similar bleeding pattern; its milder forms are relatively common. Decreased platelet numbers may be due to various causes, including insufficient production (e.g. in myelodysplastic syndrome or other bone marrow disorders), destruction by the immune system (immune thrombocytopenic purpura /ITP), and consumption due to various causes (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura /TTP, hemolytic-uremic syndrome /HUS, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria /PNH, disseminated intravascular coagulation /DIC, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia /HIT). Most consumptive conditions lead to platelet activation, and some are associated with thrombosis. The best-known coagulation factor disorders are the hemophilias. The three main forms are hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency), hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency or \"Christmas disease\") and hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency, mild bleeding tendency). Together with von Willebrand disease (which behaves more like a platelet disorder except in severe cases), these conditions predispose to bleeding. Most hemophilias are inherited. In liver failure (acute and chronic forms) there is insufficient production of coagulation factors by the liver; this may increase bleeding risk. Thrombosis is the pathological development of blood clots, and embolism is said to occur when a blood clot (thrombus) migrates to another part of the body, interfering with organ function there. Most cases of thrombosis are due to acquired extrinsic problems (surgery, cancer, immobility, obesity, economy class syndrome), but a small proportion of people harbor predisposing conditions known collectively as thrombophilia (Distance: 0.8620342016220093)\n",

Many patients with even very low FXI levels (< 20 IU dL(-1) ) are asymptomatic or exhibit only mild bleeding, whereas others experience severe bleeding, usually following trauma. Neither FXI antigen nor activity predicts the risk of bleeding in FXI-deficient patients. (i) Characterize the formation, structure and stability of plasma clots from patients with severe FXI deficiency and (ii) determine whether these assays can distinguish asymptomatic patients ('non-bleeders') from those with a history of bleeding ('bleeders'). Platelet-poor plasmas were prepared from 16 severe FXI-deficient patients who were divided into bleeders or non-bleeders, based on bleeding associated with at least two tooth extractions without prophylaxis. Clot formation was triggered by recalcification and addition of tissue factor and phospholipids in the absence or presence of tissue plasminogen activator and/or thrombomodulin. Clot formation and fibrinolysis were measured by turbidity and fibrin network structure by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Non-bleeders and bleeders had similarly low FXI levels, normal prothrombin times, normal levels of fibrinogen, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor and factor XIII, and normal platelet number and function. Compared with non-bleeders, bleeders exhibited lower fibrin network density and lower clot stability in the presence of tissue plasminogen activator. In the presence of thrombomodulin, seven of eight bleeders failed to form a clot, whereas only three of eight non-bleeders did not clot. (Distance: 0.8425644040107727)\n",

Bleeding manifestations, FXI levels and origin of members of 13 unrelated families harboring the type I mutation were determined. In addition, eight intragenic and five extragenic polymorphisms were analyzed in patients with a type I mutation, in 16 unrelated type II homozygotes, in 23 unrelated type III homozygotes and in Ashkenazi Jewish controls. Analysis of these polymorphisms enabled haplotype analysis and estimation of the age of the type I mutation. Four of 16 type I heterozygotes (25%) and 6 of 12 (50%) compound heterozygotes for type I mutation (I/II and I/III), or a type I homozygote had bleeding manifestations. Haplotype analysis disclosed that like type II and type III mutations, the type I is also an ancestral mutation. An age estimate revealed that the type I mutation occurred approximately 600 years ago. The geographic distribution of affected families suggested that there was a distinct origin of the type I mutation in Eastern Europe. (Distance: 0.8518013954162598)\n",

      "  - Mutations in the ATP7A gene cause Menkes syndrome. As the result of a mutation in the ATP7A gene, copper is poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes that are necessary for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels and the nervous system. This condition is inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome (one of the two sex chromosomes). In males, who have only one X chromosome, one altered copy of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, who have two X chromosomes, a mutation must be present in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than females. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons. About one-third of cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. (Distance: 0.8592736124992371)\n",

      "  - This study seeks to determine whether menstrual-related migraine (MRM) has a discrete, attributable impact on migraine chronicity and medication overuse. Menstrual-related migraine can be a disabling headache on its own; but when seen in headache clinics, it is often enmeshed in the setting of chronic migraine (CM) and medication overuse headache (MOH). Whereas nonspecific migraine preventives bestow their benefit uniformly, hormonal preventives (HPs)--when they are successful--address a discrete hormonal mechanism. They confer no known benefit to migraines that are not hormonally triggered. This selective property of HPs could potentially isolate MRM and segregate its effect on the overall clinical picture. This is a retrospective review of 229 consecutive women seen in follow-up for hormonal prevention of MRM at an academic headache center. Patients kept standardized diaries from which separate menstrual-week (MW) and nonmenstrual week (nonMW) headache indices were calculated and compared. Resolution of MRM was defined by reduction of the MW headache index to a score not exceeding the nonMW headache indices. Consumption of all acute and preventive agents used in the preceding month was tallied. We performed post-treatment comparisons of medication usage and headache characteristics among subjects in whom MRM was resolved and those in whom it was not resolved. At baseline, CM was present in 92% of subjects, 72% of whom also met criteria for MOH. Resolution of MRM was achieved in 81% of subjects who were compliant with HP and was associated with reversion to episodic migraine (59% vs 18%, P < .001) and resolution of medication overuse (54% vs 20%, P < .001).

      "  - To describe a standardized methodology for the performance of peripheral nerve blocks (PNBs) in the treatment of headache disorders. PNBs have long been employed in the management of headache disorders, but a wide variety of techniques are utilized in literature reports and clinical practice. The American Headache Society Special Interest Section for PNBs and other Interventional Procedures convened meetings during 2010-2011 featuring formal discussions and agreements about the procedural details for occipital and trigeminal PNBs. A subcommittee then generated a narrative review detailing the methodology. PNB indications may include select primary headache disorders, secondary headache disorders, and cranial neuralgias. Special procedural considerations may be necessary in certain patient populations, including pregnancy, the elderly, anesthetic allergy, prior vasovagal attacks, an open skull defect, antiplatelet/anticoagulant use, and cosmetic concerns. PNBs described include greater occipital, lesser occipital, supratrochlear, supraorbital, and auriculotemporal injections. Technical success of the PNB should result in cutaneous anesthesia. Targeted clinical outcomes depend on the indication, and include relief of an acute headache attack, terminating a headache cycle, and transitioning out of a medication-overuse pattern. Reinjection frequency is variable, depending on the indications and agents used, and the addition of corticosteroids may be most appropriate when treating cluster headache.

      "  - To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oral zolmitriptan 5 mg and 10 mg and placebo in cluster headache. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, three-period, crossover, outpatient study. Adult patients received placebo and zolmitriptan 5 mg and 10 mg orally for the acute treatment of episodic or chronic cluster headache. Headache intensity was rated by a five-point scale: none, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe. Patients only treated moderate to very severe headaches. The primary efficacy measure was headache response (two-point or greater reduction from baseline in the cluster headache rating scale) at 30 minutes. Secondary efficacy measures included proportion of patients with initial headache relief within 15 and 30 minutes, mild or no pain at 30 minutes, meaningful headache relief, and use of escape medication. A total of 124 patients took at least one dose of study medication, with 73% having episodic and 27% chronic cluster headache. For the primary endpoint, there was a treatment-by-cluster-headache-type interaction (p = 0.0453). Therefore, results are presented separately for chronic and episodic cluster headache. In patients with episodic cluster headache, the difference between zolmitriptan 10 mg and placebo at 30 minutes reached significance (47% versus 29%; p = 0.02). Mild or no pain at 30 minutes was reported by 60%, 57%, and 42% patients treated with zolmitriptan 10 mg, zolmitriptan 5 mg, and placebo (both p </= 0.01 versus placebo). For all other secondary endpoints, zolmitriptan 10 mg was significantly superior to placebo in episodic cluster headache patients, whereas zolmitriptan 5 mg was significantly superior to placebo for three of the four secondary endpoints. In patients with chronic cluster headache, response rates following zolmitriptan 5 mg or 10 mg were not significantly different from placebo at any endpoint. Zolmitriptan 5 mg and 10 mg were well tolerated. (Distance: 0.8752658367156982)\n",

      "  - Migraine triggered by oral contraception (OC)-free interval is very common and may be extremely severe, long-lasting and poorly responsive to analgesics (status migrainosus). The serotoninergic (5-HT) system is crucially involved in pain threshold and it is sensitive to estradiol (E2). Therefore, we aimed to assess neuroendocrine correlates of OC status migrainosus in response to the direct central 5-HT agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) and to test the effect of transdermal E2 supplementation of the OC-free interval. Clinical investigative protocol, single-blinded placebo-controlled treatment. Oral m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg body weight) challenge test was performed in 10 patients with status migrainosus occurring within 48 h of the discontinuation of a monophasic pill (30 microg of ethinyl estradiol and 150 microg of desogestrel) and in six healthy women assuming the same OC as controls. In a consecutive menstrual cycle, patients with OC status migrainosus underwent to the same test after they were blindly treated with 2.0 g of percutaneous E2 gel or placebo daily during the pill-free interval. Plasma prolactin and cortisol levels and clinical characteristics of migraine attacks were evaluated. Women with OC-status migrainosus showed a derangement of prolactin release (F = 4.8; P < 0.01) and a lack of cortisol response (F = 5.8; P < 0.001) after m-CPP in comparison with controls. Transdermal E2 during the pill-free interval significantly restored prolactin (F = 2.8; P < 0.01) and cortisol responses (F = 18.9; P < 0.001) against placebo and positively affected the duration (P < 0.001), the number of hours in which pain intensity prohibits daily activity (P < 0.001), the episodes of vomiting (P < 0.001) and the consumption of analgesics (P < 0.001).

      "  - The inherited molecular defect in patients with LAD is a deficiency of the β-2 integrin subunit, also called CD18, of the leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, which is found on chromosome 21. This subunit is involved in making three other proteins (LFA-1, Integrin alphaXbeta2, and Mac-1/CD3) This basically means that the gene creates a non-functioning protein. This results in the lack of important molecules which help neutrophils make their way from the blood stream into the infected areas of the body (ie the lungs in pneumonia). Those neutrophils which do manage to make it to the infected areas have a difficult time phagocytosing (swallowing) the bacteria. The bacteria can then proliferate, leading to symptomatic infection. The infection can spread unimpeded and cause serious injury to important tissue. (Distance: 0.9031341671943665)\n",

For example, cardiac actin was shown to be involved in pathogenesis of cardiac septum defects and smooth muscle actin in pathogenesis of aortic aneurysm in combination with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). In the present study, we further searched for mutations in human α-cardiac actin (ACTC1) and smooth muscle α-actin (ACTA2) genes as a possible cause of atrial septum defect type II (ASDII) and PDA. Total genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood of 86 individuals with ASDs and 100 individuals with PDA. Coding exons and flanking intron regions of ACTC1 (NM_005159.4) and ACTA2 (NM_001613) were amplified by PCR with specific primers designed according to the corresponding gene reference sequences. PCR fragments were directly sequenced and analyzed. Sequence analysis of ACTC1 and ACTA2 did not identify any nucleotide changes that altered the coding sense of the genes. In ACTC1 gene, we were able to detect one previously described nucleotide polymorphism (rs2307493) resulting in a synonymous substitution. The frequency of this SNP was similar in the study and control group, thus excluding it from the possible disease-associated variants. (Distance: 1.0127626657485962)\n",

Defective immunoglobulin secretion leading to dysregulated immune function is believed to be main pathophysiological mechanism of CVID. Defective B cell differentiation into plasma cells, results in inability to produce specific immunoglobulins. Multiple immuno-regulatory dysfunction leads to hypogammaglobulinemia. CVID is associated with a high occurrence of autoimmune, inflammatory, and malignant disorders, whereas these conditions are not observed in X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), a disease that affects early B cell development. CVID appears to result from a number of gene defects. which may be either recessive in inheritance or autosomal dominant. Some of these are due to defects of B cell signalling molecules but additional genes affecting immune regulation may also lead to the CVID phenotype.

Why do some AR patients develop asthma but others do not, and which factors play a role in the development of asthma that have so far not been clearly elucidated. We hypothesize that children with AR who have the Clara cell secretory protein (CC16, secretoglobin 1A1) 38A/38A genotype (rs3741240) have an increased likelihood of developing asthma. The study sample included 117 children, with AR, but no asthma diagnosed within the following 5 years, as the control group. Cases group (n=202) included age- and gender-matched children with AR first, and asthma developed 3-5 years later, as the study group. The CC16 genotype was determined by PCR and Sau96I restriction digestion of PCR products. The serum CC16 levels were measured by ELISA. Total serum IgE, allergen specific IgE, eosinophil count and pulmonary function were also measured. In children with rhinitis who develop asthma, the frequencies of the AA genotype were significantly higher than those who did not develop asthma [odds ratio (OR)=2.527; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.571-4.065; P<0.01]. Serum CC16 levels in the children with rhinitis who develop asthma and carry the AA genotype were significantly lower than those who carry the non-AA genotype and those who did not develop asthma.

The goal of this study was to identify proteins that interact with LYST as a first step in understanding how LYST modulates lysosomal exocytosis. Fourteen cDNA fragments, covering the entire coding domain of LYST, were used as baits to screen five human cDNA libraries by a yeast two-hybrid method, modified to allow screening in the activation and the binding domain, three selectable markers, and more stringent confirmation procedures. Five of the interactions were confirmed by an in vitro binding assay. Twenty-one proteins that interact with LYST were identified in yeast two-hybrid screens.

Exposure was defined as the use of any FA-containing product for an average of at least 4 days per week during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, whereas no exposure was defined as no use of FA in these 12 weeks. Of the 223 cases, 110 (49%) were exposed versus 84 (46%) of the 184 controls. After adjustment for possible confounders, no protective effect of FA was found on heart anomalies overall (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.61-1.47) nor separately for conotruncal defects, VSDs, ASDs, or ECDs.

Prenatal diagnosis of the disease can optimize the preoperative condition of the patient and may help in the prevention of acidosis. In this retrospective study we compared the occurrence of metabolic acidosis in patients with and without prenatal diagnosis of a congenital heart disease. Data of 408 patients who needed an operation for congenital heart disease within 31 days of life were analyzed retrospectively. Arterial blood gases at fixed time intervals and worst blood gas of 81 patients with and 327 patients without a prenatal diagnosis were compared, categorizing the patients on ductus dependency, anticipated univentricular or biventricular repair, and left-sided, right-sided, or no heart obstruction. In the overall group significant differences in lowest pH, lowest base excess, and highest lactate level were found, with metabolic acidosis more common among the patients with a postnatal diagnosis. In the group of patients with ductus-dependent congenital heart disease, the difference between patients receiving a prenatal and those receiving a postnatal diagnosis was more significant than in the group with non-ductus-dependent lesions. Analyzing patients with right-sided, left-sided, and no obstruction separately, significant differences were found in the group with left-sided heart obstruction for lowest pH and base excess and in the group with right-sided heart obstruction for lowest base excess.

To determine if such strategies reduce detection of cystic periventricular leukomalacia (cPVL) and persistent ventricular enlargement (pVE)--late sonographic abnormalities highly predictive of adverse neurodevelopment in preterm infants. Timing, findings, and number of neurosonograms were reviewed for all survivors born at < or = 32 weeks' gestation at University Hospital, Denver, Colo., between January 1992 and June 1995. Of 236 surviving infants, 61 (26%) were never scanned, and 175 (74%) had a total of 432 scans. Only 106 infants (45%) had a neurosonogram on or after 28 days (timed to detect all cPVL/pVE). Eleven infants (4.7%) had cPVL, and 19 (8%) had pVE. Severity of clinical course did not predict development of cPVL, but was a better predictor of pVE. Initial neurosonograms were normal in 6/11 (55%) with cPVL and 5/19 (26%) with pVE. Screening declined from 86% of infants in 1992 (average 2.54 neurosonograms each), to 64% by 1994-1995 (average of 2.22 neurosonograms each).

We tested the hypothesis that a single muscle contraction produces extracellular ADO rapidly enough and in physiologically relevant concentrations to be able to contribute to the rapid vasodilation that occurs at the onset of muscle contraction. We stimulated four to five skeletal muscle fibres in the anaesthetized hamster cremaster preparation in situ and measured the change in diameter of arterioles at a site of overlap with the stimulated muscle fibres before and after a single contraction (stimulus frequencies: 4, 20 and 60 Hz; 250 ms train duration). Muscle fibres were stimulated in the absence and presence of non-specific ADO membrane receptor antagonists 8-phenyltheophylline (8-PT, 10(-6) M) or xanthine amine congener (XAC, 10(-6) M) or an inhibitor of an extracellular source of ADO, ecto-5'-nucleotidase inhibitor α,β-methylene adenosine 5'-diphosphate (AMPCP, 10(-5) M). We observed that the dilatory event at 4 s following a single contraction was significantly inhibited at all stimulus frequencies by an average of 63.9 ± 2.6% by 8-PT. The 20-s dilatory event that occurred at 20 and 60 Hz was significantly inhibited by 53.6 ± 2.6 and 73.8 ± 2.3% by 8-PT and XAC respectively. Further, both the 4- and 20-s dilatory events were significantly inhibited by AMPCP by 78.6 ± 6.6 and 67.1 ± 1.5%, respectively, at each stimulus frequency tested. (Distance: 0.9583414793014526)\n",
      "  - To demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo monitoring of the myogenic differentiation process from human muscle precursor cells to mature skeletal muscle tissue by measuring characteristic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging relaxation and diffusion properties as a potential noninvasive diagnostic tool in muscle cell therapy. The study was approved by the ethics committee for studies in humans and the animal care committee. The hypothesis was tested by means of subcutaneous injection of human muscle precursor cells from the rectus abdominis muscle into nude mice (n = 18). Animals injected with human fibroblasts, prostate cancer cells, or collagen served as control animals (four in each group). T1, T2, T2*, and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were measured at 4.7-T MR imaging. MR imaging parameters were statistically evaluated by using analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. The engineered muscle was characterized by means of immunofluorescence, Western blot, and contraction assays. Muscle tissue in the early stages of the differentiation process exhibited distinctly higher T1 (mean ± standard deviation, 2242 msec ± 116), T2 (224 msec ± 18), and T2* (33.3 msec ± 3.6) values and ADCs (1.53 × 10(-3) mm(2)/sec ± 0.03) compared with those of skeletal muscle.

      "  - While it is now understood that the tissue geometry and the electric field distribution are important in generating virtual electrodes, the effects of interaction between a collection of electrodes have not been examined. To develop a basis for understanding such interactions, we have studied a single pair of oppositely polarized virtual sources. Although such oppositely polarized pairs of virtual electrodes can be generated by a variety of field distributions and tissue geometries, we examine one simple system that incorporates the salient features of source interaction. Our model system is a homogeneous tissue strip stimulated by a uniform extracellular field. To clarify virtual source interaction, we show that field stimulated tissue can be equivalently polarized by a set of intracellular current sources with magnitude and distribution defined by the generalized activating function. In our model system, an intracellular current source is produced at one edge of the tissue and an intracellular current sink at the other. Therefore, the tissue length acts to modulate the overlap, or interaction, between the polarizations arising from each source. To quantify the effects of source interaction, the chronaxie and rheobase values of the strength-duration relation were determined for source separations varying between 1.0 cm and 100 microm (active membrane dynamics were modeled with the Luo-Rudy phase I formulation). At all separations >3.0 mm, the chronaxie was constant at 3.09 msec and the rheobase was 0.38 V/cm. Under 0.2 mm, the chronaxie decreased to 0.55 msec while the rheobase increased linearly with the inverse of source separation. The dependence of these parameters on separation primarily reflects passive electrotonic interactions between the two virtual electrodes. However, the exact values are strongly dependent upon active tissue properties-largely the inward rectifier potassium channel and activation of the sodium current. (Distance: 1.026322364807129)\n",

Three electrosurgical generators with 0.4, 1.5, and 3 MHz frequency outputs were studied. Current was applied using a metallic needle introduced into a piece of cow liver, with different amounts of energy delivered at multiple points. Cross-sections of the liver were then studied for tissue effect. The diameters of the coagulated areas at the deepest and most superficial parts were measured. The tendency of the currents for penetration in the deeper layers of tissue rather than in the superficial layers was assessed using the superficial diameter/deep diameter ratio. Diameter of coagulated area was larger around deeper parts than around superficial parts of the electrode. No correlation between frequency of current and the superficial/deep diameter ratio of the coagulation zone was found. (Distance: 1.0341506004333496)\n",

Twenty-two human subjects exercised under four different conditions - combinations of loads of 25 or 65% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and the direction of plantarflexion at a sagittal and off-sagittal angle. Before and after each exercise condition, T2-weighted magnetic resonance images were collected. Regions of interest were drawn around the lateral gastrocnemius (LG), medial gastrocnemius (MG), soleus (SOL), peroneus longus (PER) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles and analyzed for differences. Significant increases in T2 relaxation times during 25% MVC conditions were found for PER and, during the 65% MVC, for all four muscles considered plantarflexors (LG, MG, SOL, PER). No significant differences were found between sagittal and off-sagittal conditions.

For in-vitro studies of smooth muscle cell activity, arterial smooth muscle cells were cultivated from human plaque tissue excised from 22 coronary and peripheral lesions and treated with the antitubulin colchicine. Smooth muscle cell migratory activity was analyzed by a standardized semi-automatic video system. Transmission electron microscopy was used to examine cytoplasmic structures. Colchicine caused a concentration-dependent decrease in smooth muscle cell proliferative activity at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5 nmol/l. Smooth muscle cell migratory activity was reduced by colchicine in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50, 3 nmol/l).

      "  - Force generation and transmembrane ion pumping account for the majority of energy expended by contracting skeletal muscles. Energy turnover for ion pumping, activation energy turnover (E(A)), can be determined by measuring the energy turnover when force generation has been inhibited. Most measurements show that activation accounts for 25-40% of isometric energy turnover. It was recently reported that when force generation in mouse fast-twitch muscle was inhibited using N-benzyl-p-toluenesulphonamide (BTS), activation accounted for as much as 80% of total energy turnover during submaximal contractions. The purpose of this study was to compare E(A) measured by inhibiting force generation by: (1) the conventional method of reducing contractile filament overlap; and (2) pharmacological inhibition using BTS. Experiments were performed in vitro using bundles of fibres from mouse fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Energy turnover was quantified by measuring the heat produced during 1-s maximal and submaximal tetanic contractions at 20 and 30 degrees C. E(A) measured using reduced filament overlap was 0.36 +/- 0.04 (n = 8) at 20 degrees C and 0.31 +/- 0.05 (n = 6) at 30 degrees C.

      "  - Since 2004, glucosamine has been available as a prescription drug for symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate osteoarthritis. The aim of this study was to characterize glucosamine utilization patterns, and patients' concomitant use of other analgesics, as well as the prescribers' medical specialty. We searched the Norwegian Prescription Database for all glucosamine prescriptions dispensed during the years 2004, 2005 and 2006, and prescriptions for analgesics with codeine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reimbursed for arthrosis for the same patients. In the three-year period, 91,107 patients received 297,558 prescriptions for glucosamine-corresponding to a total cost for patients of 70 mill. NOK. 86 % of patients were more than 50 years old, 69 % were women. Among physicians with a known specialty, 84 % of prescribers were specialists in general practice. 33.3 % of patients used glucosamine all three years. Among the patients who used glucosamine regularly 19 % were prescribed NSAIDs, while 22 % of them used analgesics containing codeine. Patients who started taking glucosamine did not reduce their use of analgetics containing codeine. A positive correlation was seen between use of glucosamine and use of NSAIDs.

      "  - Formalin injected in the knee joint of rats produces concentration-dependent nociception, edema, and plasma leakage (PL). Herein, we investigated the effect of histamine H1 receptor (H1R) antagonists in this model. Articular nociception was inferred from the paw elevation time (PET; seconds) during 1-minute periods of stimulated walking, determined every 5 minutes, throughout a 60-minute experimental session. Edema was evaluated by the increase in articular diameter (AD; mm), and PL was measured by the amount of Evans blue dye in the synovial fluid (PL; μg/mL). Loratadine and cetirizine, given systemically, both increased the PET. None of the treatments changed the AD and PL. Loratadine given locally with formalin increased the PET but was without effect when given in the contralateral knee. Systemic loratadine was also without effect when formalin was coinjected with sodium cromoglycate. Histamine and the selective H1R agonist 2-pyridylethylamine decreased the PET and potentiated morphine spinal analgesia, but did not affect the AD and PL. Cetirizine prevented the antinociceptive effect of the H1R agonist. The N-methyl-D-aspartate/histamine-site agonist tele-methylhistamine coinjected with formalin only increased PET. Serotonin alone had no effect on the PET and increased the AD, and the highest dose increased the PL. When coinjected with formalin, serotonin only caused hypernociception, and the highest dose also increased AD. NAN 190, cyproheptadine, and ondansetron (respectively, 5-HT1, 5-HT2, and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists) decreased the PET without changing the AD or PL. Collectively, these results suggest that in rats, the H1R plays an antinociceptive role within the knee joint, while serotonin receptors play a pronociceptive role. (Distance: 0.8683946132659912)\n",

      "  - The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the drugs and techniques used for multimodal postoperative pain management in the older population undergoing surgery in the ambulatory setting. Interest has grown in the possibility of adding adjuncts to a single shot nerve block in order to prolong the local anesthetic effect. The rapid and short-acting local anesthetics for spinal anesthesia are potentially beneficial for day-case surgery in the older population because of shorter duration of the motor block, faster recovery, and less transient neurologic symptoms. Another recent advance is the introduction of intravenous acetaminophen, which can rapidly achieve rapid peak plasma concentration (<15 min) following infusion and analgesic effect in ∼5 min with a duration of action up to 4 h.

      "  - Noninvasive measurements of limb systolic pressures are used routinely in the assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial disease, including the evaluation for critical limb ischemia. However, ankle pressures cannot be measured reliably in patients with medial calcification, which is especially common among patients with diabetes. Skin lesions on the toes or previous digital amputations may preclude the measurement of toe pressures. Measurements of skin perfusion pressure (SPP) are not subject to such limitations and were shown to be useful in the assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial disease. Because toe pressure is often used in the evaluation of severity of arterial disease and in the assessment for critical ischemia, we undertook to study whether there is a sufficient correlation between toe pressure and foot SPP that would allow the use of SPP measurements when toe pressures cannot be measured. Measurements were carried out in 85 limbs of 71 patients referred to the vascular laboratory for evaluation for peripheral arterial disease. Diabetes mellitus was present in 43 patients. Each patient had foot SPP and toe pressure measurements. Toe pressures measured with photoplethysmography were correlated with foot SPP measured with laser Doppler scanning. There was a strong linear correlation between SPP and toe pressure (r = 0.87; P <.01). Also, significant correlation was found in both the patients with diabetes and the patients without diabetes (r = 0.85 and 0.93, respectively; P <.01 in both cases).

      "  - The main focus of diabetic foot screening should be on peripheral neuropathy detection, since foot ulcer development is rare in the absence of neuropathy. In addition to examining the peripheral neuropathy, physicians should search for any evidence of skin integrity loss, anatomical deformities, nail changes, and distal pulses when they screen diabetic patients. It is recommended to perform a careful foot examination at least annually in diabetic patients who are over the age of 15. Nevertheless, there are some risk stratification systems that can provide a better understanding of how often foot screenings should be performed based on each patient. These systems utilize factors such as peripheral arterial disease, impaired protective sensation of foot, anatomical deformities, history of previous foot ulcer or amputation, and the presence of other concurrent disorders. One of the IWGDF guidelines on the management and prevention of diabetic foot recommended a foot screening assessment sheet for physical examination in each screening. Physicians should educate patients to perform self foot examinations more often. There are diagnostic tools in order to perform a better screening such as the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament, a tuning fork, and a biothesiometer. (Distance: 0.9222817420959473)\n",

Retrospective study of patients that presented within 12 hours of pain onset and were subsequently found to have choledocholithiasis. We identified 40 patients with complete medical records. Levels of aspartate and alanine aminotransferases (AST and ALT) correlated with duration of pain (Pearson correlation, r = 0.633 and 0.622 respectively, P < .001 for both); the correlation was not as strong for γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (r = 0.326, P = .046) and was not significant for alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin. This temporal association was stronger in patients that had undergone cholecystectomy versus those with intact gallbladders (for ALT, r = 0.603 vs r = 0.311, respectively). Eighteen patients, evaluated within 6 hours of pain, had normal or minimal alterations in LFTs; transabdominal ultrasound was abnormal in 6 (sensitivity 33.3%).

However, it would seem that mild elevations of amylase and lipase rarely predict significant pancreatic pathology. Pancreatic imaging tests are expensive. The gold standard, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, carries risk of morbidity and mortality. To determine whether extensive investigation of patients with mild, nonspecific abdominal symptoms and mild elevations of amylase and/or lipase results in a significant diagnostic yield. Outpatient evaluations were retrospectively analyzed over 12 months. Inclusion criteria were nonspecific abdominal pain, and mild elevations (less than three times the upper limit of normal) of serum amylase or lipase, or both. Exclusion criteria included a history of chronic pancreatitis, elevation of liver tests and acute pain syndromes. Nineteen patients over the study period met the criteria. Of the nineteen patients, 58% had elevation of lipase alone, 21% amylase alone and 21% had elevations of both. In addition, 89.5% of the patients had nonspecific abdominal pain.

Cholecystokinin-cholescintigraphy (CCK-CS) has been used to evaluate for CAGD, with a gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF) of <35 % being indicative of gallbladder dysfunction. The reproduction of biliary colic upon administration of CCK has been cited as indicative of CAGD. Our purpose was to determine whether low GBEF or reproduction of pain during CCK-CS was predictor of surgical outcomes related to resolution of symptoms or as a correlate to gallbladder pathology. A retrospective review of patients was performed to evaluate adults with a diagnosis of CAGD who underwent CCK-CS prior to surgical intervention. CPT and ICD-9 coding queries were used to identify the patient population. Patients with cholelithiasis were excluded. Sixty-four patients met inclusion criteria. Two patients were lost to follow-up and were excluded. During CCK-CS, 41 patients (66 %) reported symptoms similar to their presenting complaint. Twenty-one patients reported no symptoms with CCK-CS. There was no significant relationship between gallbladder pathology and either GBEF or reproduction of symptoms with CCK-CS (p = 0.14). About 81 % of patients (n = 50) had relief of symptoms following cholecystectomy. Sixty-six percentage of patients (n = 33) with long-term symptom relief after cholecystectomy had reproduction of symptoms with CCK-CS. Nineteen percentage of all patients (n = 12) had long-term symptom recurrence despite surgery. Eight of these patients (66 %) had symptom reproduction with CCK-CS. There was no significant correlation with either the GBEF or symptoms reproduction with CCK-CS as a predictor of postoperative outcome (p = 0.12). (Distance: 0.7433761358261108)\n",
